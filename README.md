# Narrowing Action Choices with AI Improves Human Sequential Decisions

This repository contains the code and data for the paper Narrowing Action Choices with AI Improves Human Sequential Decisions.

## Dependencies

All the experiments were performed using Python 3.11.2 In order to create a virtual environment and install the project dependencies you can run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Repository structure


- `human_study_data` contains the human subject data (see README).
- `notebooks` contains python notebooks to generate the figures included in the paper.
- `outputs` contains intermediate output files generated by the experiments' scripts.
- `scripts` contains a set of scripts used to run all the experiments presented in the paper. 
- `src` contains all the source code of the experiments.

## Training and evaluating the DQN
First generate the training set of game instances by running:

```
python -m src.rl.generate_instances
```

Then train the DQN by running 

```
python -m src.rl.train
```

Analysis of the training is included in `notebooks/training_analysis.ipynb` To evaluate the DQN against the (heuristic and random) baselines run:

```
python -m src.rl.evaluate
```

Analysis of the results is in `notebooks/agent_analysis.ipynb`.

## Evaluation on the human subject study.

To evaluate the DQN on the game instances of the human subject study run:

```
./scripts/eval_dqn.sh
```
The results will be saved under `outputs/rewards`
To run the bandit algorithms, run: 
```
./scripts/bandits.sh
```

The evaluation plots on the human subject study are in `notebooks/study.ipynb`.
